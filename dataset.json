If it is, the function returns `False` because there is a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis.\n    - Otherwise, it compares the current closing parenthesis with the top element of the stack. If they match, it removes the top element from the stack and continues the loop. If they don't match, the function returns `False`.\n* Once the loop completes, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the sequence of parentheses is valid. Otherwise, there are unmatched opening parentheses, and the function returns `False`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n>>> is_valid('()')\nTrue\n>>> is_valid('(()())')\nTrue\n>>> is_valid('(()())()')\nTrue\n>>> is_valid('()())')\nFalse\n>>> is_valid('()(){}')\nFalse\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n), because the function creates a new list `stack` to store the encountered parentheses."

We define `dp[j]` as the maximum value that can be achieved with a knapsack capacity of `j`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Initialize `dp` table with zeros for all capacities.\n\n2. Iterate over items.\n3. Iterate over knapsack capacities in descending order, starting from the capacity of the knapsack plus the fixed capacity.\n4. For each capacity, if the current item's weight is less than the capacity, we update `dp[j]` to the maximum of its current value and the value of the solution with the current item added.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nweights = [2, 3, 5]\nvalues = [6, 10, 12]\ncapacities = [5, 7]\nfixed_capacity = 2\n\nknapsack_value = knapsack_dynamic(weights, values, capacities, fixed_capacity)\n\nprint(knapsack_value)  # Output: 22\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n * c), where n is the number of items and c is the knapsack capacity.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(c), due to the creation of the `dp` table.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The fixed capacity is added to the knapsack capacity for each item.\n* This solution is suitable for knapsack problems where the knapsack capacity can be increased by a fixed amount for each item."

It involves:\n\n1. Exploring a solution space by making choices.\n2. Checking if the current solution is valid.\n3. If valid, proceed. If not, backtrack and try a different choice.\n4. Continue exploring until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.\n\n\n**Rat in a Maze Problem:**\n\nThe Rat in a Maze problem involves finding a path from the starting point to the exit in a maze without obstacles.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef rat_maze(maze, start, end):\n    if start == end:\n        return True\n\n    for neighbor in get_neighbors(start):\n        if is_valid(maze, neighbor):\n            if rat_maze(maze, neighbor, end):\n                return True\n\n    return False\n\n# Other functions:\n- get_neighbors: Calculates neighboring cells\n- is_valid: Checks if a cell is valid (not an obstacle)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The function takes three arguments: the maze, the start and end points.\n2. It starts by checking if the start point is the end point. If yes, it returns True.\n3. It iterates over neighboring cells of the current position.\n4. If the neighbor is valid (not an obstacle), it recursively calls itself with the neighbor as the new start point.\n5. If the recursion returns True, it means a path was found.\n6. If the recursion returns False, it means no path was found from that neighbor.\n7. If no valid neighbors are found, the function returns False.\n\n**Key Aspects:**\n\n- The solution involves exploring multiple paths until a valid path is found.\n- The algorithm backtracks when it encounters an obstacle or reaches a dead end.\n- The recursion depth is limited by the size of the maze.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n- Worst case: O(2^n), where n is the size of the maze.\n- Best case: O(n), when the solution is found quickly.\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\n- O(n), due to the recursive call stack."

It involves:\n\n**1. Exploring:**\n- Starting with a partial solution (initial state).\n- Expanding the solution by making valid moves.\n\n\n**2. Checking:**\n- Checking if the solution is complete (goal state).\n- If yes, the solution is accepted.\n- If no, backtrack by retracting the last move.\n\n\n**3. Expanding:**\n- If the solution is not complete, explore other possible moves from the current state.\n\n\n**4. Repeating:**\n- Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until either a solution is found or all possible moves have been explored.\n\n\n**Applications of Backtracking:**\n\n- Maze solving\n- Crossword puzzles\n- Scheduling problems\n- Path planning\n- Knight's Tour\n\n\n## Knight's Tour Problem\n\nThe Knight's Tour problem involves finding a path for a knight to visit every square of a chessboard once and only once.\n\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(board, row, col):\n    return row >= 0 and row < len(board) and col >= 0 and col < len(board[0]) and board[row][col] == 0\n\ndef knight_tour(board, row, col, path):\n    if len(path) == len(board) * len(board[0]):\n        return True\n\n    for row_move, col_move in [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, -1), (1, -2), (-1, -2), (-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, 2)]:\n        new_row, new_col = row + row_move, col + col_move\n        if is_valid(board, new_row, new_col):\n            board[new_row][new_col] = len(path) + 1\n            if knight_tour(board, new_row, new_col, path + [new_row, new_col]):\n                return True\n    board[row][col] = 0\n    return False\n\ndef solve_knight_tour(board):\n    if knight_tour(board, 0, 0, []):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\n- The `knight_tour` function takes the current row and column, along with a list of visited squares.\n- It checks if the current position has already been visited.\n- If not, it iterates over possible moves of the knight and recursively calls itself with the updated position and visited list.\n- If a solution is found, it returns `True`.\n- If no solution is found, it returns `False`.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\n- The provided code is a recursive implementation.\n- Recursive algorithms can be memory inefficient for large problems. In such cases, iterative approaches are more suitable."

        "rejected": "**Step 1: Choose a Data Structure**\n\n* A heap is a suitable data structure for implementing a priority queue.\n* Python provides the `heap` module with built-in functions for heap operations.\n\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Priority Queue**\n\n```python\nimport heap\n\ndef priority_queue():\n    return []\n```\n\n**Step 3: Inserting an Element**\n\n```python\ndef enqueue(queue, item, priority):\n    heap.heappush(queue, (priority, item))\n```\n\n**Step 4: Removing the Highest Priority Element**\n\n```python\ndef dequeue(queue):\n    return heap.heappop(queue)[1]\n```\n\n**Step 5: Checking if the Queue is Empty**\n\n```python\ndef is_empty(queue):\n    return not queue\n```\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# Create a priority queue\nqueue = priority_queue()\n\n# Insert elements with priorities\nenqueue(queue, 'A', 1)\nenqueue(queue, 'B', 2)\nenqueue(queue, 'C', 3)\n\n# Dequeue the elements in order of priority\nwhile not is_empty(queue):\n    item = dequeue(queue)\n    print(item)  # Output: 'A', 'B', 'C'\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n* Insertion: O(log n)\n* Dequeuing: O(log n)\n* Checking if empty: O(1)\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of the heap.\n\n**Advantages of Using a Heap for a Priority Queue:**\n\n* Efficient insertion and deletion of the highest priority element.\n* Stable and well-tested data structure.\n* Provides a complete binary tree structure.\n\n\n**Disadvantages of Using a Heap for a Priority Queue:**\n\n* Not suitable for storing large objects, as the heap can become memory inefficient.\n* Other data structures may be more efficient for certain operations, such as sorting or searching.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The `heapify()` function can be used to convert any list into a heap.\n* The `heappop()` function removes and returns the highest priority element from the heap.\n* The `heapreplace()` function can be used to update the priority of an existing element in the heap."

If not, it raises an error.\n* It then builds a max heap using the `heapify()` function from the `heapq` module. The heap will store the k largest elements in the array.\n* It iterates through the `k` elements and extracts the largest element from the heap using `heappop()`.\n* Finally, it returns the kth largest element, which is the top element of the heap.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(k log k), where k is the value of `k`.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(k), due to the creation of the heap.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* The `heapify()` function builds a heap from a list.\n* The `heappop()` function removes the top element (the largest element) from a heap.\n* The negative sign in the heap is used to maintain the max heap property. The actual values in the heap are negative of the actual values in the array."
