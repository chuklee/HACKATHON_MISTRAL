If so, it creates a new node with the given value and returns it as the head of the list.\n* It iterates through the linked list until it finds a node with a value greater than or equal to the value of the new node.\n* It stores the previous node (prev) and the current node (curr) during the iteration.\n* It creates a new node with the given value (new_node) and sets its next pointer to the current node.\n* It then sets the previous node's next pointer to the new node.\n* Finally, it returns the head of the updated linked list.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\n# Example linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nhead = Node(1)\ninsert_node(head, 2)\ninsert_node(head, 4)\ninsert_node(head, 3)\n\n# Print the linked list\nwhile head:\n    print(head.val)\n    head = head.next\n# Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n```\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the linked list.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n\n**Note:**\n\n* This function assumes that the linked list is sorted in ascending order.\n* The `Node` class is not defined in the code snippet, but it is a class that represents a node in a linked list with a `val` and a `next` pointer."
